# Changelog

## 1.0.0 — unreleased

The first public release, staged and waiting on the go-public decision.

Logician gives any MCP client verified control of Logic Pro: 83 typed tools across
mixing, plugins (third-party parameters included), regions, MIDI composition and
editing, tempo and meter maps, automation, markers, and dialog-free audio export —
with every render coming back as audio the agent can listen to.

### Highlights

- **Verified writes everywhere.** Compare-and-set with readback against Logic's own
  control-surface echoes; refusals name the fix or the working alternative; results
  carry `success` / `verified` / `state` / `warning` under one documented contract.
- **The master chain is addressable.** `Stereo Out`, auxes and buses work by name for
  volume, mute/solo, sends, insert bypass, plugin parameters and preset browsing.
- **Tempo and meter maps are read, integrated and editable** — bar math follows the
  project's actual tempo track and signature list; Smart Tempo mode is checked before
  recording so an Adapt-mode project is refused rather than rewritten.
- **Audio-carrying results**, inline for multimodal clients and as fetchable MCP
  resource links for everyone else; renders live under `logician://captures/`.
- **Modern protocol**: 2026-07-28 era (`server/discover`, per-request versioning,
  cache hints) with legacy `initialize` down to 2025-03-26; progress notifications and
  cancellation on every long-running tool; the server is inert until first use.
- **A whole arrangement in one call.** `logic_import_midi` writes many named tracks as a
  byte-exact Standard MIDI File and drives Logic's own importer - seconds instead of the
  music's own length, no Smart Tempo hazard, verified by a track/region census diff and
  optionally note for note out of the Event List.
- **Typed discovery.** `logic_find_tool` searches every tool by keyword (BM25 over names,
  descriptions and argument text) and answers with the full typed definitions — schemas and
  safety annotations included — naming the toolset that holds any match this session does
  not offer. In every toolset, never touches Logic.
- **`--toolsets`** launch flag for clients with hard tool caps (`core` = 41 tools);
  the full surface is designed for client-side tool search.

### Known limitations (honest by design)

- English Logic UI assumed (v1); tested against Logic Pro 12.3.1 on macOS 15.
- Tempo curves are integrated as steps (Logic's Tempo List does not expose them);
  the uncertainty is quantified in results.
- Track stacks cannot be freeze-rendered (Logic limitation; `solo_bounce` covers it).
- Recorded automation cannot target headerless strips (`Stereo Out`, auxes, buses).
- MIDI recording runs in real time.

### Deferred, deliberately

- Homebrew formula ships alongside this release; a simpler installer for musicians
  without a terminal is planned.
- Offline audio analysis (spectrum/LUFS) is a non-goal: Logician's job is verified
  interaction, and real audio to multimodal ears is the analysis story.
